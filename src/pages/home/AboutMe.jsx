            Hey! Iâ€™m <span className="font-semibold text-3xl text-blue-600">Rifat</span>,
            a passionate web developer who loves turning ideas into interactive,
            user-friendly web applications. My coding journey began with
            curiosity and has grown into a deep interest in full-stack
            development, especially using the{" "}
            <span className="font-medium text-gray-300">MERN Stack</span>.
            <br />
            <br />
            I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and help me
            growâ€”whether itâ€™s building sleek frontends or solving backend logic
            puzzles. Clean code and meaningful design are what I always aim for.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beyond tech, Iâ€™m someone who enjoys a good football match âš½,
            sketching in free time ðŸŽ¨, and exploring new tools or trends in the
            dev world. I believe creativity and continuous learning go hand in
            hand, both in coding and in life.
